# tokenised-api-credits (scaffold)

This repository is a scaffolded starting point for the Tokenised API Credits monorepo described in Docs A–E.

See `docs/` for the technical specification and guides:

- `docs/doc_a.md` — Architecture & technical spec
- `docs/doc_b.md` — Interfaces & contract reference
- `docs/doc_c.md` — Project plan
- `docs/doc_d.md` — Deployment/run guide
- `docs/doc_e`   — Copilot Build Guide / Master Instruction

Quick start (dev):

1. Build and start the local compose environment:

   make up

2. Run the demo script (in WSL/Git Bash or a Unix shell):

   ./scripts/demo.sh

Notes
- This is an initial scaffold implementing a minimal Gateway service and local compose configuration. Many components in Doc E remain TODO and are intentionally minimal.
